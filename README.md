## Specific Changes Made
* Updated all pages with grid layout inorder to implement bootstrap responsiveness.
* I did not use media queries because I was able to take care of sizing in bootstrap.
* I added bootstrap nomenclature to my portfolio page to make the rows and columns much more responsive.
* I added a boostrap navbar to mywebsite with a dropdown button.  The button has been disabled but the intention was to design the responsiveness with a dropdown in mind. I also intentionally customized navbar to make it more like my previous homework site.
* I used a fixed-bottom class to create a sticky footer.
